# OpenGL Basic Scene with GLFW and GLEW

I have made this project for the laboratory assessment of the Computer Graphics subject in the third year of faculty.

This project implements a basic scene with global illumination, a driveable car model, collision detection and character movement.

More information can be found in the documentation of the project avaliable in the repository.
